This example demonstrates a common misunderstanding with Perl's foreach loop and the next statement. The next statement in a Perl foreach loop only skips to the next iteration, not the next element in the array.  This can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled correctly. The solution shows how to achieve the desired behavior by using a for loop or other approaches.
